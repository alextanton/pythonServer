# Python Server
Python server for c++ RAT to connect. Clearly a work in progress and not very effcient...

TODO:
  - [x] Client and server into classes and create run.py
  - [x] Comment code
  - [ ] Fix client selector more space effcient
  - [ ] Unique ID for each victim - easier to search and easier to choose vitim to operate on
  - [ ] Decouple client.py and server.py AKA allow for a three tiered system (have to run server in VNC mode to use GUI)
  - [ ] Make sure each command shows in GUI
  - [ ] GUI needs to be more verbose
  - [ ] Shell interaction with victim
